# Pages Directory

Top-level application pages that don't belong to a specific feature.

## When to use this directory

Place standalone pages here that are:
- Public pages (landing, home, about, pricing)
- Error pages (404, 403, 500)
- Legal pages (terms, privacy)
- One-off pages that don't fit into features

## Current Pages

- **home/** - Public landing page (marketing)
- (Add more standalone pages as needed)

## Note

If a page has complex logic or multiple related components, consider making it a feature in `features/` instead.
